Supporting Organizations
The Center for Model-based Cyber-Physical Product Development (MODPROD) is an inter-disciplinary research center at Linköping University. It revolves around model-based tools and methods for cyber-physical systems, mechanical systems, electronic systems and software, and unified approaches for model-based design. This workshop brings together expertise in these fields to discuss state of the art and the way ahead. 
The Open Source Modelica Consortium (OSMC) is a non-profit organization supporting the development of the OpenModelica Open-Source implementation of Modelica and related tools, e.g. OMSimulator for FMI based modeling and simulation, ModelicaML (UML-Modelica integration), OMOptim, OMPython, OMJulia, OMDebugger, for industrial and academic usage.
The IEEE Computer Society traces its origins to the 1946 and advances the theory, practice, and application of computer and information-processing science and technology. The Swedish Chapter has been recommending MODPROD to its members since 2015.
INCOSE Sweden is the Swedish chapter of the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) with an objective to strengthen the systems engineering discipline through knowledge exchange, networking, and career-advancement opportunities.
